# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the 2020 Slovak Parliamentary Elections

The Jupyter Notebook file Slovak Elections 2020_Python EDA.ipynb contains the analysis and an explanation of the steps taken. The dataset is in the results_by_district.csv file, which contains election results by electoral district. 

### Python libraries used

- Pandas: used for data analysis tools
- Matplotlib: data visualization and graphs
- Folium: geographical map data visualization
- PyWaffle: visualization of parliamentary seat allocation

Note that Folium maps are not properly displayed on Github. An image of the output is used to illustrate the actual output that would be displayed on a Jupyter Notebook.
